For each site, a section element, and within it the name (as a clickable link, as an h3) - if you haven't already adjust your default.css so you your links are not blue/purple/red... use pseudo classes to adjust things. 
Within that section put a paragraph with a simple description of the site, followed by an unordered list with each of the CRAP principles, followed by your assessment of the site's following/not following of those principles in the form of a sentence or two.
